# Private Measurement

As established in [the 2022/02/09 meeting](https://github.com/patcg/meetings/blob/main/2022/02/09-telecon/README.md#minutes), this community group is interested in doing further work on private measurement and attribution processes and standards. As proposals around private measurement are developed further we should discuss them centrally and work outside the context of meetings. 

This repository and its issues have been created to open up such a space to discuss the specific subset of Private Advertising Technology that deals with private measurement. 

Additional file PRs should stem from Community Group work in this space; other work and discussion should happen via the issues space. 

If the discussion in this repository leads to the need for discussion in a meeting, [open an issue in the meetings repository to add to the agenda](https://github.com/patcg/meetings/issues/new?assignees=AramZS%2C+seanturner&labels=agenda%2B&template=agenda-item-template.md&title=Agenda+Request+-++) of the next meeting. 

Issues and PRs opened in this space will send to the email listserv.
